# Javascript Concepts

### 1.Syntax Parser
A program that reads your Code and determines what it does and if the Grammar is Valid.
Compilers/Interpretors convert our Program into something that computer can understand.They are intermediates
Syntax Parser is a part of it.

### 2.Lexical Environment:
Where something sits "Physically" in th code we write.
Lexical means having to do with words or grammar.A lexical environment exists in programming languages in which where you write something is important.

Ex: A variable sits lexically inside the function.The compiler makes decision how it is going to be stored in memory

### 3.Execution Context:
A wrapper to help manage the Code that is Running.
There are a lot of Lexical environments,which one is currently runnning is managed via execution contexts.It can contain things beyond what we have written in our code.
